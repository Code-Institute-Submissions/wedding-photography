### Overview

A website for a wedding photographer. The website features a home page, an about page, a gallery to showcase the photographer’s portfolio and a contact page so clients can enquire about bookings. The driving force of the website is to increase bookings. The way this is achieved is by directing potential clients to that contact page, being personable and honest about their approach to wedding photography, and displaying images throughout the website. 

### User Stories

* I want to be able to easily navigate the website. 
* I want to be able to view the photographer’s portfolio to see if their style suits my needs. 
* I want to be able to easily find the relevant information. 
* I want to be able to contact the photographer for any questions I may have. 
* I want to know more about the photographer. 
* I would like to see the photographer’s social media accounts to see more of their work. 

### Project Goals

* I want to increase bookings for photographic services. 
* I want to increase brand awareness. 
* I want to grow my social media following. 
* I want to be contactable by potential clients.

### UX 

The aim of this website is to target couples who are planning their wedding. The priority focus is to drive potential clients to the contact page, as well as the social media accounts. Before deciding on a photographer for a wedding, it’s important to view their portfolio. For this reason, I opted to use a simple, and minimalist design with lots of photos. 

I also aimed to be very personable in text as it's not only the photos that attracted potential clients, but also the person behind the camera. 

#### Strategy 

The goal of the website is to showcase the photographer's portfolio, to increase brand awareness by driving potential clients to social media accounts, and to grow bookings and enquiries via the contact page. 

###### Business Goals: 

Increase brand awareness.
Showcase examples of previous photographic events.
Drive users to the contact page to increase the number of bookings. 
Mobile first design to target large audiences who don’t have a PC/Laptop. 
Simple and effective UX to keep focus on the portofolio.

###### Customer Goals: 

Mobile friendly website.   
Searching for a high quality wedding photographer. 
A simple, and easy to navigate website. 
Possible to view photographer’s portfolio.
Contact the photographer easily. 
Being able to connect via social media. 
Someone who understands the importance of capturing special moments. 

#### Scope 

The Scope and features of this project were based on market research of similar photographers in the wedding industry. A simple and clean UX which allows the focus to remain on the two most important aspects of the website; the portfolio and the contact page. 

#### Structure 

I am opting for a clean, and minimalist UI and UX. While the nav bar links to the relevant pages, I also linked the portfolio and contact pages via a button beneath the About Me snippets on the Home page. I feel this helps to keep a streamlined approach to the website, and reduces users scrolling up/down every time they want to navigate between important pages. 

I kept the text sections of the website short with enough relevant information about the photographer and their approach to not overwhelm clients with unnecessary text and information. 

#### Skeleton 

All wireframes were developed with Balsamiq. As there are slight design changes for the mobile/tablet/desktop versions of the site, I have created wireframes for each screen type. I have linked the relevant pages below.

#### Surface 

###### Colours
I chose to employ a minimilist and clean design for the website. 

I decided to use an off-white (#f7f7f7) background colour which works well with the images used throughout the website. Many images were black and white and I felt the off-white background color complimented these photos. 

The hero image on the home page also complimented the background color. For this reason, I opted to use a transparent navigation menu. 

The only other color I used was #212529 which is a dark grayish blue. I decided to use this instead of an all out black color for text, headings, and borders as I believe it was easier on the eyes, and also complimented the off-white (#f7f7f7) background colour. 

###### Font

I decided to use the Merriweather font for my navigation bar, as I felt it was very easy on the eyes, and worked well with the overall theme of the website. 

For the headings and body of text, I chose to Fira Sans font as it paired well with Merriweather. I also liked that Fira Sans was a weighty font, and popped with the off-white background. 

### Features 

#### Current Features 

I chose to just show two reviews on mobile instead of three which is what is feautred on the desktop. This was a design choice as three reviews on the mobile site felt cluttered. 

I also chose to remove the carousel feature on mobile, as it felt more intuitive to scroll through photos on mobile, as opposed to tapping the carousel arrows. 


#### Future Features 

I would like to add a feature which would allow the purchasing of photos buy adding a shopping section for clients. Clients could input their allocated password, and choose which photos from their wedding they would like to purchase. 

### Technologies Used 

This website was developed using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). 

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to structure the website, and to assist in keeping the website responsive across a variety of devices. 

Bootstrap was linked into the html document via [CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). 

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for numerous icons used throughout the website. These include the hamburger icon in the mobile navigation bar, social media footer links, and quotation marks in the testimonial section of the website. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import typography. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control tool to store version of files and track progress.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the IDE used to work on this project. 

[Github](https://github.com/) to manage my Git repositories. 

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) to check validity of HTML code. 

[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check validity of CSS code. 



#### Testing

* I tested each navigation link on every page to ensure that they directed to the correct page.
* I also tested the navigation brand to ensure that it directed users back to the home page. 
* I tested each social media link in the footer to make sure that they linked to the correct social media website, and also opened up a new tab when clicked. 
* I tested each button on every page to ensure that they directed to the relevant sections. 
* I opened DevTools and checked the responsiveness of each page on desktop screens to small mobiles to ensure that the website was responsive across all devices. 
* I tested the carousel arrows to make sure that the right arrow moved to the next image, and the left arrow reverted back to the previous image. 
* I tested each section of the contact form to make sure that the form could not be submitted without the required fields having the necessary information. 
* I also tested the contact form to ensure that once filled in correctly, there were not any errors prefenting it from being submitted. 
* I tested the Portfolio page on mobile to make sure the iamges had the correct spacing. 
* I re-tested all pages on mobiles to ensure that there weren't any erros with button functionality and button spacing. 
* I also used Google Mobile Friendly-Test to further test the website on mobile.
