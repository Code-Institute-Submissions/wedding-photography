### Overview

A website for a wedding photographer. The website features a home page, an about page, a gallery to showcase the photographer’s portfolio and a contact page so clients can enquire about bookings. The driving force of the website is to increase bookings. The way this is achieved is by directing potential clients to that contact page, being personable and honest about their approach to wedding photography, and displaying images throughout the website. 

### User Stories

* I want a website which is easily accessed on my mobile phone or tablet. 
* I want to be able to easily navigate the website. 
* I want to be able to view the photographer’s portfolio to see if their style suits my needs. 
* I want to be able to easily find the relevant information. 
* I want to be able to contact the photographer for any questions I may have. 
* I want to know more about the photographer. 
* I would like to see the photographer’s social media accounts to see more of their work. 

### Project Goals 

* I want to showcase my photography portfolio. 
* I want to increase bookings for photographic services. 
* I want to increase brand awareness. 
* I want to grow my social media following. 
* I want to be contactable by potential clients. 
* I want an easy to navigate website for customers. 

### UX 

The aim of this website is to target couples who are planning their wedding. The priority focus is to drive potential clients to the contact page, as well as the social media accounts. Before deciding on a photographer for a wedding, it’s important to view their portfolio. For this reason, I opted to use a simple, and minimalist design with lots of photos. 

I also aimed to be very personable in text as it's not only the photos that attracted potential clients, but also the person behind the camera. 

#### Strategy 

The goal of the website is to showcase the photographer's portfolio, to increase brand awareness by driving potential clients to social media accounts, and to grow bookings and enquiries via the contact page. 

###### Business Goals: 

Increase brand awareness.
Showcase examples of previous photographic events.
Drive users to the contact page to increase the number of bookings. 
Mobile first design to target large audiences who don’t have a PC/Laptop. 
Simple and effective UX to keep focus on the portofolio.

###### Customer Goals: 

Mobile friendly website.   
Searching for a high quality wedding photographer. 
A simple, and easy to navigate website. 
Possible to view photographer’s portfolio.
Contact the photographer easily. 
Being able to connect via social media. 
Someone who understands the importance of capturing special moments. 

#### Scope 

The Scope and features of this project were based on market research of similar photographers in the wedding industry. A simple and clean UX which allows the focus to remain on the two most important aspects of the website; the portfolio and the contact page. 

#### Structure 

I am opting for a clean, and minimalist UI and UX. While the nav bar links to the relevant pages, I also linked the portfolio and contact pages via a button beneath the About Me snippets on the Home page. I feel this helps to keep a streamlined approach to the website, and reduces users scrolling up/down every time they want to navigate between important pages. 

I kept the text sections of the website short with enough relevant information about the photographer and their approach to not overwhelm clients with unnecessary text and information. 

#### Skeleton 

All wireframes were developed with Balsamiq. As there are slight design changes for the mobile/tablet/desktop versions of the site, I have created wireframes for each screen type. I have linked the relevant pages below.

#### Surface 

###### Colours
I chose to employ a minimilist and clean design for the website. 

For my navbar, and footer I decided to use an off-white/yellow (#DEDCD7) background colour which works well with the images used throughout the website. Many images were black and white and I felt the background color complimented these photos. The navbar color also complimented the home page hero image as the color is present within the image. 

For my background color, I opted to use a much lighter shade the navigation bar, mixed with a white (#ffff) this resulted in a dark white (#EAE9E8) which helped the text and photos pop, while not feeling out of place or diminishing the UX. 

For text color, and buttons and borders I chose to use the color #212529 which is a dark grayish blue. I decided to use this instead of an all out black color for text, headings, and borders as I believe it was easier on the eyes, and also complimented the off-white (#f7f7f7) background colour. 

###### Font

I decided to use the Merriweather font for my navigation bar, as I felt it was very easy on the eyes, and worked well with the overall theme of the website. 

For the headings and body of text, I chose to Fira Sans font as it paired well with Merriweather. I also liked that Fira Sans was a weighty font, and popped with the off-white background. 

### Features 

#### Current Features 

I chose to just show two reviews on mobile instead of three which is what is feautred on the desktop. This was a design choice as three reviews on the mobile site felt cluttered. 

Initially, I wanted to use a carousel to display photos, however upon researching carousel interaction stats, it seems that most research indicates that less than 1% of users click on this feature. Given the importance of quickly capturing a user's attention especially in the portfolio section it seemed like a poor UX and UI design choice. Instead I opted for a grid layout which quickly shows the photographer's photos. 

#### Future Features 

I would like to add a feature which would allow the purchasing of photos buy adding a shopping section for clients. Clients could input their allocated password, and choose which photos from their wedding they would like to purchase. 

### Technologies Used 

This website was developed using [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS). 

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to structure the website, and to assist in keeping the website responsive across a variety of devices. 

Bootstrap was linked into the html document via [CDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). 

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for numerous icons used throughout the website. These include the hamburger icon in the mobile navigation bar, social media footer links, and quotation marks in the testimonial section of the website. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import typography. 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control tool to store version of files and track progress.

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the IDE used to work on this project. 

[Github](https://github.com/) to manage my Git repositories. 

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) to check validity of HTML code. 

[W3C CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check validity of CSS code. 

#### Testing

* I tested each navigation link on every page to ensure that they directed to the correct page.
* I also tested the navigation brand to ensure that it directed users back to the home page. 
* I tested each social media link in the footer to make sure that they linked to the correct social media website, and also opened up a new tab when clicked. 
* I tested each button on every page to ensure that they directed to the relevant sections. 
* I opened DevTools and checked the responsiveness of each page on desktop screens to small mobiles to ensure that the website was responsive across all devices. 
* I tested the carousel arrows to make sure that the right arrow moved to the next image, and the left arrow reverted back to the previous image. 
* I tested each section of the contact form to make sure that the form could not be submitted without the required fields having the necessary information. 
* I also tested the contact form to ensure that once filled in correctly, there were not any errors prefenting it from being submitted. 
* I tested the Portfolio page on mobile to make sure the iamges had the correct spacing. 
* I re-tested all pages on mobiles to ensure that there weren't any erros with button functionality and button spacing. 
* I also used Google Mobile Friendly-Test to further test the website on mobile.

#### Troubleshooting

* For the quote section, I wanted an icon in the middle of a horizontal line. I had a lot of trouble implementing this, and I found a solution on Stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39129052/add-font-awesome-icon-in-middle-of-horizontal-line )

* I ran into an issue where there is some extra margin showing on the right-hand side of mobile devices. I found a fix in setting a media query with my navbar padding max-width for mobile. Solution found on Stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17815390/large-right-margin-when-browser-is-shrunk-to-mobile-size-on-bootstrap)

* When adding images for the images on the home page - specfically for the section with two photos in black and white, there was another problem with overflow on the right-hand side. I solved the issue by adding 0px padding in the container. 

* I ran into an issue where I was unable to hide an image on mobile only. Looking through the bootstrap documentation, I found a solution with display classes "d-none d-sm-block". 

* I had an issue when adding a hover effect to the navbar items. I only wanted to target the nav menu items, and not the navbar brand. However, when I hovered over the brand an underline border would appear. I resolved the issue by further targeting the nav menu items with .mynav ul a {}

* I also had an issue when using the hover effect for nav-items where there would be a slight jump in the page. This was due to an issue with the underline border. I found a fix via [Youtube](https://youtu.be/LV3w60037EI?t=1074). The soultion was to add a transparent border targeting the same class which would elimante the little jump when hovering over nav items. 

* I also experienced an issue with the large photo on the contact.html page. On desktop the image was centered, however on mobile the image took up too much space. This was resolved by adding a media query for smaller devices and setting the height vh lower than on desktops. 

* I wanted to collapse the navbar on mobile by clicking outside of the nav menu, instead of clicking the hamburger menu. I found a solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked/36406437#36406437) which allowed me to collapse the navbar without clicking the hamburger icon everytime.
